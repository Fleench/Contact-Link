# Contact Link

Contact Link synchronizes your Obsidian vault with a CardDAV server so your notes can store real contact information. The plugin creates and updates Markdown files based on your address book and lets you edit contacts directly from Obsidian.

## Features

- Connect to a CardDAV server (such as Zoho) and pull contact details.
- Store contact fields in frontmatter (`phone`, `email`, `birthday`, `company`).
- Create or update notes in a chosen folder when syncing.
- View a simple dashboard table of all contacts with links to call or email.
- Basic settings for server URL, credentials and note folder.

This repository contains only a minimal example implementation. CardDAV parsing and two-way updates require further development.
