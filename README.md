# Contact Link

Contact Link synchronizes your Obsidian vault with a CardDAV server so your notes can store real contact information. The plugin creates and updates Markdown files based on your address book and lets you edit contacts directly from Obsidian.

## Features

- Two-way sync with your CardDAV server.
- Customisable frontmatter mapping for contact fields.
- Import contacts from a CSV file (`contacts.csv`).
- Dashboard table with phone and email actions and mention counts.
- Birthday calendar exported as an ICS file.
- Commands to insert contact links in any note.

This project still provides only a lightweight example implementation but now demonstrates how a more complete contact manager could be built.

### Zoho CardDAV Setup

Set the CardDAV URL to:

```
https://contacts.zoho.com/dav/<your-email>/contacts/
```

Use your Zoho credentials for authentication.
